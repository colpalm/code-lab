# language-laboratory

A feature-by-feature experimental compairon of Python, Java and Rust performance characteristics.

## Overview

This project compares the performance characteristics of Python, Java, and Rust across various programming features and patterns. Each experiment is designed to provide objective metrics.

## Getting Started

Language Versions:
- Python: 3.12.0
- Java: TBD
- Rust: TBD

This project uses language-specific package managers:
- Python: uv
- Java: Maven
- Rust: Cargo

To set up the development environment, install the appropriate versions and tools for each language.
